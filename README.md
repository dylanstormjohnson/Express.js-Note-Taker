## Description

- This project was made using Javascript, Node.js.  I was motivated to build this project to learn more about express.js and routing.  It was built because I wanted an easy way to store information in the form of notes quickly.  It is intended to solve the problem of building my own HTML code for a notes I have made instead of producing it dynamically.  In making said project, I learned a lot about routing and file structure.
